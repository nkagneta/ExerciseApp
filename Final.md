I tired to add the typeahead functionality to my exercise app, unfortunately I could not get the enire thing to work. I tried to implement a loop to add new players to an array as they joined, then search through that array with the typeahead. While doing this I realized my sharing aspect of the exercise app, (having other players able to see new added exercises and who added them) stopped working. I tried to troubleshoot the messages aspect of that sharing capability but couldn't quite figure it out (It was working last night :/  ). I commented out my changes to keep functionality. Thank you for the great semester!
