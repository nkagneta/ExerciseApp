# ExerciseApp

Spring 2018 Web Server Programming - Final Project

This app will allow users to track their exercies habits as they attempt to develop a healthy life-style. Users will be able to log exercise activity and performance records on a day to day basis. Along with the ability to log information, they will be able to share what they have accomplished through social media.

This is my first commit from VS Code
